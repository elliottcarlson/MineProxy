MineProxy
=========

Simple MineCraft proxy server and custom notification system

MineProxy allows you to display custom error messages to your users when necessary.
For example, if your server is down for maintenance, or there is a non-compatible
server build available yet, you can display a notice to your users explaining the
situation instead of dealing with a downed and unavailable server.
